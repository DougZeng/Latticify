Latticify is an Android app for [Slack](https://slack.com/). It's still in its early stages of development.

## Features‚ú®

## Buildüõ†
### Download the source code
```shell
git clone https://github.com/TonnyL/Latticify.git
```

### Setup API Keys
You need to register your application at [Slack API home](https://api.slack.com/). You can find information about how to gain access via the relevant links.

When you obtain the keys, you need to place them into the `latticify.propterties` file.

```java
CLIENT_ID=<YOUR CLIENT ID>
CLIENT_SECRET=<YOUR CLIENT SECRET>
VERIFICATION_TOKEN=<YOUR VERIFICATION TOKEN>
```

‚ö†Ô∏èNotice: The `latticify.properties` file is not committed to git, so you need to create it manually.

As for *Callback URL*, you need to define your own url and then modify relative constants in [Api.kt](./mobile/src/main/java/io/github/tonnyl/latticify/retrofit/Api.kt).

### Open the project in Android Studio
Latticify requires **Android Studio 3.0 (or newer).**

Open the `Latticify/` directory in Android Studio.

### Get Started
```shell
./gradlew build
```

### Troubleshoot
+ Update Android Studio to latest version.
+ Update Kotlin to latest version.
+ Try to clean the project and rebuild it.
+ If none of the solutions above, file an issue or email me.
